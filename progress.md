# ♟️ Chessify Protocol — Comprehensive Project Progress & Context

> **PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT**: This file serves as the canonical onboarding context for any LLM or developer picking up this project. It describes the full architecture, deployed state, file-by-file inventory, known issues, and roadmap. Read this before touching any code.

**Current Phase**: Phase 3 — Multi-Chain Integration (Hybrid Proto-Launch)  
**Last Updated**: April 23, 2026  
**Repo**: `github.com/jadonamite/Chessify`  
**NPM Package**: `chessify-protocol@0.1.2` (public, MIT)  
**Author**: `jadonamite`

## 📐 Project Identity

Chessify is a **free-to-play, fully on-chain chess protocol** deployed across two blockchains:

| Chain | Language | Status | Token Standard |
|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Stacks** (Bitcoin L2) | Clarity 2/4 | ✅ Mainnet | SIP-010 Fungible Token |
| **Celo** (EVM) | Solidity 0.8.20 | ✅ Mainnet | ERC-20 |

**Economic Model**: CHESS tokens are free (faucet-minted, 1,000 CHESS/day). STX and CELO are used for gas only. Zero financial risk. Wagers use CHESS exclusively.

## 🔑 Deployed Contract Addresses

### Stacks Mainnet (ACTIVE — Consolidated 2-Contract System)

| Contract | Identifier | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **chess-token-v3** | `SP6X0MXEEGZX14ZTK7XQXJ76W35ZJDP9NZBT6F39.chess-token-v3` | SIP-010 token + vault + gateway-release |
| **chess-game** | `SP6X0MXEEGZX14ZTK7XQXJ76W35ZJDP9NZBT6F39.chess-game` | Full game engine (lifecycle, escrow, Elo, timeout) |
| **automata-agent** | `SP6X0MXEEGZX14ZTK7XQXJ76W35ZJDP9NZBT6F39.automata-agent` | AI agent attestation |

> **CRITICAL**: The README.md describes a legacy 7-contract architecture (router, registry, escrow, logic, timer, ranking, token). This has been **superseded** by the consolidated 2-contract system (`chess-token-v3` + `chess-game`). The `contracts/` folder still contains the legacy `.clar` files but only `chess-token-v3.clar`, `chess-game.clar`, and `automata-agent.clar` are active on mainnet.

### Celo Mainnet

| Contract | Address | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| **ChessToken** | `0xE370aad742dF8DC8Ae9c0F0b9f265334D39e2197` | ERC-20 CHESS token |
| **ChessGame** | `0xf85f00D39A84b5180390548Ea9f76B0458607E78` | Game engine (mirrors chess-game.clar) |

### Deployer / Owner

- **Stacks**: `SP6X0MXEEGZX14ZTK7XQXJ76W35ZJDP9NZBT6F39`
- **Celo**: Deployer wallet stored in `.env` as `PRIVATE_KEY` / `MNEMONIC`

## ⚙️ Smart Contract Architecture (Detailed)

### Stacks: `chess-token-v3.clar` (Contract 1 of 2)

**Purpose**: SIP-010 fungible token that also acts as the escrow vault.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Token Name | Chess Token |
| Symbol | CHESS |
| Decimals | 6 |
| Faucet | 1,000 CHESS per wallet per ~1 day (144 blocks) |
| Vault Pattern | The contract *itself* holds wager tokens — players transfer CHESS to `.chess-token-v3` |
| Gateway Release | `gateway-release(amount, recipient)` — **only callable by `.chess-game-v3`** |
| Mint Control | `mint-enabled` bool, togglable by CONTRACT-OWNER |

**Token Flow (Clarity 4 pattern — no `as-contract` needed)**:
```
DEPOSIT:  Player → ft-transfer? → .chess-token-v3 (vault)
PAYOUT:   chess-game calls chess-token.gateway-release(amount, winner)
          → ft-transfer? runs in chess-token's context
          → can spend .chess-token-v3's own balance natively
```

**Key Functions**:
- `transfer(amount, sender, recipient, memo)` — standard SIP-010
- `faucet-claim()` — anyone claims 1,000 CHESS per day
- `mint(amount, recipient)` — owner only
- `batch-mint(list)` — owner seeds up to 10 recipients
- `gateway-release(amount, recipient)` — **privileged**, only chess-game can call
- `get-vault-balance()` — read the escrow balance

**Error Codes**: u100 (not authorized), u101 (mint disabled), u102 (invalid amount), u105 (faucet cooldown), u106 (same sender)

---

### Stacks: `chess-game.clar` (Contract 2 of 2)

**Purpose**: Complete game engine — lifecycle management, escrow integration, Elo rating, and timeout enforcement.

**Game Status Codes** (mirrors Solidity `GameStatus` enum):
| Code | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| u0 | WAITING | Created, waiting for opponent |
| u1 | ACTIVE | Both players joined, in progress |
| u2 | FINISHED | Win/loss result |
| u3 | CANCELLED | Creator cancelled before join |
| u4 | DRAW | Agreed draw |

**Game Storage Map** (`games: uint → {...}`):
```
white:           principal          # Game creator
black:           (optional principal)  # Opponent (none until joined)
wager:           uint               # CHESS tokens wagered (0 = free)
status:          uint               # STATUS-* constant
turn:            principal          # Whose move it is
move-count:      uint               # Total moves made
created-at:      uint               # Block height at creation
last-move-block: uint               # Block height of last move (for timeout)
draw-proposer:   (optional principal)  # Who proposed draw (none if no proposal)
```

**Player Stats Map** (`player-stats: principal → {...}`):
```
wins:         uint
losses:       uint
draws:        uint
rating:       uint    # Elo (starts at 1200)
games-played: uint
```

**Elo Rating System**:
- Starting Elo: 1200
- K-Factor: 32
- Min Rating: 100
- Diff cap: 400
- Formula: Integer approximation of standard expected-score
- Underdog wins → bigger gain; Favorite wins → smaller gain
- Minimum change: 1 point

**Timeout System**:
- Default: 432 blocks (~3 days at 10-min block time)
- Owner-adjustable via `set-timeout-blocks(blocks)`
- Verified on-chain via `block-height` — cannot be faked
- The player whose turn it is gets timed out; their opponent claims the win

**Public Functions (Game Lifecycle)**:
1. `create-game(wager)` → locks white's CHESS, returns game-id
2. `join-game(game-id)` → locks black's matching CHESS, activates game
3. `submit-move(game-id)` → flips turn, increments move-count, resets timeout, clears draw proposal
4. `resign(game-id)` → caller loses, opponent wins (self-harm only)
5. `report-win(game-id)` → caller claims checkmate win
6. `propose-draw(game-id)` → offers draw to opponent
7. `accept-draw(game-id)` → accepts pending draw, both refunded
8. `claim-timeout(game-id)` → claims win if opponent timed out
9. `cancel-game(game-id)` → creator cancels before join, refunded

**Read-Only Functions**:
- `get-game(game-id)`, `get-game-status(game-id)`, `get-current-turn(game-id)`
- `get-total-games()`, `can-claim-timeout(game-id)`, `get-blocks-until-timeout(game-id)`
- `get-player-stats(player)`, `get-rating(player)`

**Error Codes**: u700 (not authorized), u701 (game not found), u702 (not your turn), u703 (invalid opponent), u705 (game not active), u706 (game not waiting), u707 (not your game), u708 (timeout not met), u709 (no draw proposed), u710 (already proposed), u711 (can't accept own), u712 (transfer failed)

**Trust Model**:
- `resign()`: Caller can only hurt themselves
- `claim-timeout()`: Verified on-chain via block height
- `propose/accept-draw()`: Requires both parties
- `report-win()`: Caller claims checkmate — chess rules validated client-side by chess.js. Since CHESS tokens are free, abuse risk is minimal.

---

### Celo: `ChessGame.sol` + `ChessToken.sol`

Mirrors the Stacks contracts exactly. Key differences:
- Uses ERC-20 `safeTransferFrom` instead of Clarity `ft-transfer?`
- Players must call `ChessToken.approve(chessGameAddress, amount)` before wagering
- Uses `block.number` instead of `block-height`
- Timeout default: 360 blocks (~30 min on Celo at 5s blocks)
- Emits Solidity events (GameCreated, MoveMade, GameResigned, etc.)
- Has `GameResult` enum (None, WhiteWins, BlackWins, DrawResult, Cancelled) — not present in Clarity version

---

### `automata-agent.clar`

An on-chain attestation contract for AI agent actions:
- `attest-action(user, plan-hash)` — records a SHA-256 hash of the agent's execution plan
- `get-latest-attestation(user)` — read-only to verify the last attestation
- Stores: `plan-hash`, `timestamp` (block-height), `nonce` (incrementing count)

## 🤖 Simulation Scripts

These scripts run automated game lifecycles on mainnet to generate on-chain activity:

### `simulate-celo.cjs` (19.9KB) — Celo Mainnet Simulator
- Manages 15+ simulation wallets
- Auto-handles faucet claims
- Uses `waitForTransactionReceipt` to prevent race conditions
- Decodes hex revert signatures (e.g., `NotYourTurn`, `InsufficientAllowance`)
- Simulates: game creation, join, moves, resign, checkmate (reportWin), agreed draws
- Requires: wallets pre-funded with CELO for gas

### `simulate-stacks.js` (15.5KB) — Stacks Mainnet Simulator
- Similar flow to Celo simulator
- Uses `@stacks/transactions` for contract calls
- `TheQueenGambit.cjs` patches this file (adds retry logic, updates contract references)
- Targets the consolidated `chess-game` contract directly (not the legacy router)

### `distribute-stacks.js` (19.5KB) — STX Distribution
- Resilient to partial failures
- Detects and reuses already-funded hub wallets from previous runs
- Distributes STX gas to simulation wallets

### `icarus.js` (22.9KB) — Advanced Stacks Orchestrator
- Orchestrates complex simulation scenarios

### Supporting Scripts
- `distribute_celo.js` — distributes CELO gas to simulation wallets
- `fetch_celo_balances.js` — reads CELO balances across all wallets
- `simulate-automata.js` — runs automata-agent attestation simulations
- `scripts/generate-stacks-wallets.js` — generates wallet keypairs

## 🚧 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Critical
1. **`src/config/contracts.ts` references legacy contract names** — `STACKS_CONTRACTS` object still points to `chess-token_v2`, `chess-escrow`, `registry`, `logic`, `timer`, `ranking`, `gateway_v2`. These should be updated to the consolidated `chess-token-v3` and `chess-game` identifiers.
2. **`chess-token-v3.clar` gateway-release references `.chess-game-v3`** (line 121) — verify this matches the actual deployed contract name. The `Clarinet.toml` registers `chess-game` not `chess-game-v3`.
3. **`README.md` documents outdated architecture** — describes the 7-contract system. Needs rewrite to reflect the 2-contract consolidated model.

### Moderate
4. **All unit tests are stubs** — 7 test files exist but contain no assertions. Need actual tests covering token transfer, game lifecycle, Elo calculation, timeout, draw flow.
5. **Stacks wallet not integrated in frontend** — `@stacks/connect` is installed but no `StacksProvider` exists in `providers.tsx` or the component tree.
6. **`src/lib/index.ts` has dead commented-out code** — contains temporal anomaly comments and an abandoned ThemeToggle export.
7. **`src/files/` contains orphaned config files** — `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` appear to be archived duplicates.

### Low
8. **`chess-token.clar` (v1) defines its own SIP-010 trait** — in production, should reference the official trait from the Stacks chain. Same applies to `chess-token-v3.clar`.
9. **No error handling in `wallet-provider.tsx`** for chain mismatch — user could be on wrong EVM chain.
10. **`package.json` repo URL** points to `github.com/jadonamite/Chessify` — verify this is the canonical URL.

## 🚀 Roadmap to 1.0 (Ordered by Priority)

### P0 — Stacks Frontend Integration (Blocking)
- [ ] **Stacks Wallet Provider**: Integrate `@stacks/connect` to handle Stacks authentication alongside the existing Celo provider
- [ ] **Dual-Chain Connection**: Build a network switcher component in the lobby allowing users to select Stacks (STX/CHESS) or Celo (CELO/CHESS)
- [ ] **Stacks Contract Hooks**: Create `useStacksChess` hook (or similar) that mirrors the EVM contract interaction pattern — wrapping `openContractCall` from `@stacks/connect`
- [ ] **Update `contracts.ts`**: Replace legacy `STACKS_CONTRACTS` references with `chess-token-v3` and `chess-game`

### P1 — Gameplay & Board Integration
- [ ] **React Chessboard**: Integrate `react-chessboard` + `chess.js` into a game page — validate moves client-side, then call `submitMove()` on the respective chain
- [ ] **On-Chain Move Verification**: Currently only `move-count` is tracked. Implement lightweight hash-based verification or PGN anchoring to prevent client-side "fake wins"
- [ ] **Game Hub/Dashboard**: "My Games" page to track active matches, claim timeouts, view past games
- [ ] **Game Lobby**: List of open games (status=WAITING) that users can join

### P2 — Ecosystem & UX Polish
- [ ] **Cross-Chain Elo Leaderboard**: Merge stats from Solidity `getPlayerStats` and Clarity `get-player-stats` into a unified ranking page
- [ ] **MiniPay Optimization**: Final CSS polish for Celo MiniPay mobile browser — ensure "Launch App" flow is seamless
- [ ] **Wallet Error Handling**: Add chain-mismatch detection, wrong-network warnings, and Stacks/Celo fallback states
- [ ] **SEO & Analytics**: Meta tags, Open Graph, analytics tracking for protocol adoption metrics

### P3 — Testing & Quality
- [ ] **Contract Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive Vitest + Clarinet tests for all game lifecycle paths (create, join, move, resign, timeout, draw, cancel)
- [ ] **Elo Edge Cases**: Test underdog vs. favorite rating changes, minimum-rating floor, draw rating stability
- [ ] **Frontend Integration Tests**: Test wallet connection, contract call flows, error states

### P4 — Future Extensions (Post-1.0)
- [ ] Tournament contract (bracket-based or Swiss)
- [ ] DAO governance for protocol parameters
- [ ] NFT match certificates (proof-of-game as collectible)
- [ ] Spectator rewards
- [ ] ChessFi staking mechanics
- [ ] Leaderboard mining rewards

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Operations

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev           # Start Next.js dev server
npm run build         # Next.js production build
npm run build:lib     # Build NPM package (tsup → dist/)
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run test          # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for tests + contracts
```

### Simulation Commands
```bash
node simulate-celo.cjs           # Run Celo mainnet simulation
node simulate-stacks.js          # Run Stacks mainnet simulation
node distribute-stacks.js        # Distribute STX gas to wallets
node distribute_celo.js           # Distribute CELO gas to wallets
node fetch_celo_balances.js       # Check wallet balances
node simulate-automata.js         # Run automata attestation sim
node scripts/generate-stacks-wallets.js  # Generate new wallet keypairs
```

### Health Checks
- Verify faucet balances remain sufficient (both chains)
- Monitor gas costs for `submitMove` transactions
- Check `get-total-games()` / `totalGames()` for activity metrics

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
The `.env` file contains sensitive data including:
- Private keys and mnemonics for deployer + simulation wallets
- RPC endpoints
- Contract addresses (also hardcoded in `contracts.ts`)
- Stacks API keys

> **NEVER commit `.env` to version control.** It is listed in `.gitignore`.

## 📌 Quick Reference for LLM Agents

### "Where do I find...?"

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Active Stacks contracts | `contracts/chess-token-v3.clar` + `contracts/chess-game.clar` |
| Active Celo contracts | `celo-contracts/ChessToken.sol` + `celo-contracts/ChessGame.sol` |
| Frontend pages | `src/app/page.tsx` (landing only) |
| Wallet connection | `src/components/wallet-provider.tsx` (Celo only) |
| Contract addresses | `src/config/contracts.ts` |
| Environment variables | `.env` (root) |
| NPM package entry | `src/lib/index.ts` |
| Unit tests | `tests/*.test.ts` (stubs) |
| Clarinet config | `Clarinet.toml` |

### "What should I NOT do?"

1. **Do NOT use the legacy contracts** (router, registry, escrow, logic, timer, ranking, gateway) — they are superseded by the consolidated `chess-game.clar`
2. **Do NOT reference the README architecture diagram** for current state — it describes the old 7-contract system
3. **Do NOT assume Stacks wallet works** — only Celo EVM wallet is connected in the frontend
4. **Do NOT modify `.env`** without understanding it contains live mainnet keys
5. **Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`** before writing any Next.js code — the user's `AGENTS.md` warns about breaking changes in this version

### "What's the contract call pattern?"

**Celo (Solidity/EVM)**:
```
1. Player calls ChessToken.approve(chessGameAddress, wagerAmount)
2. Player calls ChessGame.createGame(wagerAmount)   → locks tokens via safeTransferFrom
3. Opponent calls ChessGame.joinGame(gameId)        → locks matching wager
4. Players alternate ChessGame.submitMove(gameId)   → flips turn, resets timeout
5. Game ends via resign/reportWin/claimTimeout/acceptDraw/cancelGame
6. Winner receives totalPot via safeTransfer
```

**Stacks (Clarity)**:
```
1. Player calls chess-game.create-game(wager)
   → internally: chess-token-v3.transfer(wager, tx-sender, .chess-token-v3, none)
2. Opponent calls chess-game.join-game(game-id)
   → internally: chess-token-v3.transfer(wager, tx-sender, .chess-token-v3, none)
3. Players alternate chess-game.submit-move(game-id) → flips turn, resets timeout
4. Game ends via resign/report-win/claim-timeout/accept-draw/cancel-game
5. Winner receives totalPot via chess-token-v3.gateway-release(amount, winner)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The canonical source of truth for contract architecture is this `progress.md` file and the actual deployed `.clar` / `.sol` files — NOT the README.md, which documents the superseded 7-contract system.**
